# Firebase Firestore Transaction: Handling Optimistic Update Inconsistencies
This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase Firestore transactions and optimistic updates.  When performing transactions, especially with potential network latency, relying solely on client-side confirmation of success can lead to data inconsistencies. The solution demonstrates proper error handling and data verification after the transaction completes on the server to prevent these inconsistencies.

## Problem
Client-side caching in Firestore can lead to misleading success signals from transactions.  Even if the transaction fails server-side, the client may believe it was successful, leaving data in an inconsistent state.

## Solution
The solution involves robust error handling within the `.catch` block of the transaction and implementing a mechanism to ensure the server-side outcome determines the application state, not the optimistic client-side response.  This means verifying the final state of the data on the server after the transaction completes to ensure consistency.

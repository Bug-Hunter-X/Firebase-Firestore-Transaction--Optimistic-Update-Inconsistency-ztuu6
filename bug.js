The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase that arises when dealing with transactions and optimistic updates. The issue stems from an unexpected interaction between concurrent transactions and client-side caching of data.  In this example, we attempt to increment a counter in Firestore using a transaction. However, due to network latency or other factors, the client might perceive the update as successful even if the transaction ultimately fails on the server. This can lead to inconsistent data in the database and unexpected application behavior. 
```javascript
// Function to increment a counter in Firestore using a transaction
db.runTransaction(transaction => {
  return transaction.get(counterRef).then(doc => {
    const newCount = (doc.data().count || 0) + 1;
    transaction.update(counterRef, { count: newCount });
    // The following line is problematic. Client-side caching can make this misleading.
    console.log('Counter incremented successfully (optimistic)');
    return newCount; // This value is optimistically correct on the client, not necessarily on the server
  });
}).then(result => {
  console.log('Transaction completed successfully on server:', result);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Transaction failed:', error);
});
```
